## Reflection

There is just so much new technology and frameworks that deciding what is the best to learn with my limited time can be overwhelming.  Then when I finally decide what technology to learn, navigating that documentation and modifying it to what I want to do can be very challenging, especially if the documentation is poorly written. On this project I will make a garden zone webpage to potential gardeners to enter their zipcode and get information about gardening in their area including hardiness zones, frosts dates, dates to start different plants, and some stretch goals involving recommended plants for their area.  I will use Angular 5 which was released two days ago along with firestore which is in beta, and bootstrap 4 beta.  Using this new technology will be a fun challenge as I have to navigate their documentation and modify my coding procedures to fit their new technologies.
